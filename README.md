What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

-Finding the most efficient data structure for an advising program to read course files and print course information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

-I did my best to approach the problem logically. I found it most important to consider every aspect of the program. In essence, this meant not just choosing the program with the fastest runtime, but looking at each portion of the program to see what the best structure would be. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

-I utilized two primary resources, Stack Overflow and my brother. My brother has been helpful for me as he is employed in a similar field. Stack overflow is always a valuable source for information and assistance on problems.Going back over Zybooks readings and my notes was also helpful. 


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

-I've gained a-lot of knowledge through this course on data structures and how to make programs run more efficiently.


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

-By learning many more options for data structures and runtimes, I believe my work has become more easily readable and condensed. This program has also assisted me in creating more easily edited algorithms.
